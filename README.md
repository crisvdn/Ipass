# Ipass

This is a library for the MPU-6050.
This library interfaces with the MPU-6050 Gyroscope and Accelerometer. It provides functionality to output the data easily to the screen
or return it so you can do anything with it. Any customisation for user-preferred settings can be done by supporting functions in this libary.

This library supports only I2C communication. So any versions like the MPU-6000 are not supported(SPI).
